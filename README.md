# Latitude Analysis Web Visualization

This project challenged me to create a website using data from a previous repository (What's the Weather Like) and turn it into a functioning website. The original dataset evaluated the relationship between several different weather metrics including cloudiness, humidity, max temperature, and wind speed. I did this by using a combination of html, CSS and bootstrap.  My website includes 7 different .html pages that can be navigated between.  It includes a navbar on all pages and a table of the source data. There is also a separate page for each comparison as well as a page with all four scatter plots displayed at once.
